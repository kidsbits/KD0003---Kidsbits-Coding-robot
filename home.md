## **Description**

kidsbits rolls out a Kidsbits yellow car, aiming at cultivating children’s hands-on logical analysis, creativity and problem solving ability by learning practical knowledge about electronics, mechanics, control logic and computer science.

The shell of this car is modeled after building blocks. This robot is compatible with Lego bricks，which can substantially foster numerous experiments.

Additionally, it is equipped with two passive buzzers to play music and an LED display to show the pattern to your taste.

The LED display can be combined with ultrasonic modules, which can be regarded as two eyes to make it more interesting. Furthermore, it is chargeable.

This tutorial is designed to stimulate children's interest in programming and microcontrollers. From download, installation and usage of software to the 14 projects, children can learn to program to control the yellow robot.

It adopts eco-friendly ABS757 material. As one of the synthetic resins, ABS composite has the advantages of heat-resistant, anti-chemical and low temperature resistance. It is widely applied to industrial fields such as machinery, automobiles, electronic appliances, instrumentation, textiles and construction.

  **Precaution:**

-   No sharp angles and smooth surface, easy to handle and control.
-   Sturdy strong structure,without tiny parts and risk of choking
-   Complete car body, no crack, no potential dangers for kids.
-   With plastic structure, safe and reliable.

## **Features**

-   No need to install and wire: an integrated design; the control board integrates functions such as ultrasonic, line tracking, LED display, etc.
-   Multiple functions: play music, display patterns, BT control, obstacle avoidance, line tracking and others.

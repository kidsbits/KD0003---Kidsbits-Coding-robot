## Description

kidisbits coding robot is an Arduino-based smart car designed to help children learn programming and electronic knowledge. This kind of car can realize basic forward, backward, left turn, right turn and other functions, and can be easily programmed and controlled through graphical programming software. It usually includes an Arduino development board as the main control core, as well as various sensors and actuators. Through graphical programming software, children can easily drag and connect graphical modules to realize the control and interactive functions of the car. The production process of this kind of car can stimulate children's creativity and hands-on ability, while cultivating their interest in programming and electronic technology.

  **Precaution:**

-   No sharp angles and smooth surface, easy to handle and control.
-   Sturdy strong structure,without tiny parts and risk of choking
-   Complete car body, no crack, no potential dangers for kids.
-   With plastic structure, safe and reliable.

## Features

-   No need to install and wire: an integrated design; the control board integrates functions such as ultrasonic, line tracking, LED display, etc.
-   Multiple functions: play music, display patterns, BT control, obstacle avoidance, line tracking and others.
-   High Tenacity: high quality metal motors
-   High extension: its rear is equipped with 4 sensor expansion ports; its body adopts a building block design and it is compatible with Lego bricks too, which makes it convenient for the car to connect with other modules and sensors.
-   Multiple controls: IR remote control, App control (iOS and Android system)
-   Basic programming：C language code of Arduino IDE, Kidsblock graphical programming
